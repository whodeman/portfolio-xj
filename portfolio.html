    <h3>
        <P>My name is Xavier and this program was a time filled with fun memories and great friendships that I will always cherish. I was fortunate to have amazing teachers who supported and encouraged me throughout my journey. The school provided me with numerous opportunities to learn new things, and I am truly grateful for the guidance and resources they have offered. I gained valuable skills that have been incredibly useful and will continue to benefit me in the future. Looking back, my high school experience helped shape me into the person I am today, and I will always appreciate the positive impact it has on my life.</P>
